 * Testcase Example:  '"barfoothefoobarman"\n["foo","bar"]'
 *
 * You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of
 * words are of the same length.
 * 
 * A concatenated string is a string that exactly contains all the strings of
 * any permutation of words concatenated.
 * 
 * 
 * For example, if words = ["ab","cd","ef"], then "abcdef", "abefcd", "cdabef",
 * "cdefab", "efabcd", and "efcdab" are all concatenated strings. "acdbef" is
 * not a concatenated string because it is not the concatenation of any
 * permutation of words.
 * 
 * 
 * Return an array of the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings
 * in s. You can return the answer in any order.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]
 * 
 * Output: [0,9]
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * The substring starting at 0 is "barfoo". It is the concatenation of
 * ["bar","foo"] which is a permutation of words.
 * The substring starting at 9 is "foobar". It is the concatenation of
 * ["foo","bar"] which is a permutation of words.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words =
 * ["word","good","best","word"]
 * 
 * Output: []
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * There is no concatenated substring.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]
 * 
 * Output: [6,9,12]
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * The substring starting at 6 is "foobarthe". It is the concatenation of
 * ["foo","bar","the"].
 * The substring starting at 9 is "barthefoo". It is the concatenation of
 * ["bar","the","foo"].
 * The substring starting at 12 is "thefoobar". It is the concatenation of
 * ["the","foo","bar"].
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
 * 1 <= words.length <= 5000
 * 1 <= words[i].length <= 30
 * s and words[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
