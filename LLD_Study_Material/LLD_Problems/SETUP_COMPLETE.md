## **🎨 Design Patterns Covered**

### **Behavioral Patterns:**
- ✅ **State Pattern** - Vending Machine, ATM, Games
- ✅ **Strategy Pattern** - Parking fees, Payments, Splits
- ✅ **Observer Pattern** - Logging, Elevator
- ✅ **Chain of Responsibility** - ATM cash dispensing

### **Creational Patterns:**
- ✅ **Factory Pattern** - Vehicle creation, Split types
- ✅ **Singleton Pattern** - Logger instance

### **Structural Patterns:**

## **📖 Documentation Files**

- **README.md** - General overview and setup instructions
- **INDEX.md** - Quick reference with all problem details
- **run.sh** - Helper script to compile/run any problem

---

## **🎯 Next Steps**

### **Option 1: Start with Easy Ones**
```bash
./run.sh 10    # Logging System (Singleton pattern)
./run.sh 09    # File System (Composite pattern)
./run.sh 01    # Tic Tac Toe (Basic State pattern)
```

### **Option 2: Most Interview-Relevant**
```bash
./run.sh 04    # Parking Lot ⭐⭐⭐
./run.sh 11    # Splitwise ⭐⭐⭐
./run.sh 05    # Elevator ⭐⭐⭐
```

### **Option 3: Study One by One**

For each problem:
1. **Run it:** `./run.sh XX`
2. **Read Main.java:** Understand the workflow
3. **Explore classes:** See how patterns are used
4. **Draw diagrams:** Map class relationships
5. **Ask me questions:** I'll explain concepts!

## **💬 Ready to Start?**

Tell me which problem you want to explore first:
- **04 (Parking Lot)** - Most common in interviews
- **11 (Splitwise)** - Complex debt algorithm
- **08 (Vending Machine)** - You already have one, compare!
- **10 (Logging System)** - Simplest to understand
- **Any other!**

I'll walk you through the code, explain design patterns, and help you understand the concepts! 🚀
