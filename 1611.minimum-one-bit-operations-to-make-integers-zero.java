 * Testcase Example:  '3'
 *
 * Given an integer n, you must transform it into 0 using the following
 * operations any number of times:
 * 
 * 
 * Change the rightmost (0^th) bit in the binary representation of n.
 * Change the i^th bit in the binary representation of n if the (i-1)^th bit is
 * set to 1 and the (i-2)^th through 0^th bits are set to 0.
 * 
 * 
 * Return the minimum number of operations to transform n into 0.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The binary representation of 3 is "11".
 * "11" -> "01" with the 2^nd operation since the 0^th bit is 1.
 * "01" -> "00" with the 1^st operation.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 6
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is "110".
 * "110" -> "010" with the 2^nd operation since the 1^st bit is 1 and 0^th
 * through 0^th bits are 0.
 * "010" -> "011" with the 1^st operation.
 * "011" -> "001" with the 2^nd operation since the 0^th bit is 1.
 * "001" -> "000" with the 1^st operation.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= n <= 10^9
