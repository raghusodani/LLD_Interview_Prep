 * Testcase Example:  '"1001101"'
 *
 * You are given a binary string s.
 * 
 * You can perform the following operation on the string any number of
 * times:
 * 
 * 
 * Choose any index i from the string where i + 1 < s.length such that s[i] ==
 * '1' and s[i + 1] == '0'.
 * Move the character s[i] to the right until it reaches the end of the string
 * or another '1'. For example, for s = "010010", if we choose i = 1, the
 * resulting string will be s = "000110".
 * 
 * 
 * Return the maximum number of operations that you can perform.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "1001101"
 * 
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * We can perform the following operations:
 * 
 * 
 * Choose index i = 0. The resulting string is s = "0011101".
 * Choose index i = 4. The resulting string is s = "0011011".
 * Choose index i = 3. The resulting string is s = "0010111".
 * Choose index i = 2. The resulting string is s = "0001111".
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "00111"
 * 
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
