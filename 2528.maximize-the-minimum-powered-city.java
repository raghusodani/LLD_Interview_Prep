 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array stations of length n, where
 * stations[i] represents the number of power stations in the i^th city.
 * 
 * Each power station can provide power to every city in a fixed range. In
 * other words, if the range is denoted by r, then a power station at city i
 * can provide power to all cities j such that |i - j| <= r and 0 <= i, j <= n
 * - 1.
 * 
 * 
 * Note that |x| denotes absolute value. For example, |7 - 5| = 2 and |3 - 10|
 * = 7.
 * 
 * 
 * The power of a city is the total number of power stations it is being
 * provided power from.
 * 
 * The government has sanctioned building k more power stations, each of which
 * can be built in any city, and have the same range as the pre-existing ones.
 * 
 * Given the two integers r and k, return the maximum possible minimum power of
 * a city, if the additional power stations are built optimally.
 * 
 * Note that you can build the k power stations in multiple cities.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: stations = [1,2,4,5,0], r = 1, k = 2
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: 
 * One of the optimal ways is to install both the power stations at city 1. 
 * So stations will become [1,4,4,5,0].
 * - City 0 is provided by 1 + 4 = 5 power stations.
 * - City 1 is provided by 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 power stations.
 * - City 2 is provided by 4 + 4 + 5 = 13 power stations.
 * - City 3 is provided by 5 + 4 = 9 power stations.
 * - City 4 is provided by 5 + 0 = 5 power stations.
 * So the minimum power of a city is 5.
 * Since it is not possible to obtain a larger power, we return 5.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: stations = [4,4,4,4], r = 0, k = 3
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: 
 * It can be proved that we cannot make the minimum power of a city greater
 * than 4.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == stations.length
 * 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * 0 <= stations[i] <= 10^5
 * 0 <= r <= n - 1
 * 0 <= k <= 10^9
 *
