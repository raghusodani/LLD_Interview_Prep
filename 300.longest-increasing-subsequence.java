 * Total Submissions: 4.1M
 * Testcase Example:  '[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]'
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly
 * increasing subsequence.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore
 * the length is 4.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 2500
 * -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(n log(n)) time
 * complexity?

         * longest increasing subsequence possible so far, and we will try to update
         * the dp array with the current element if it is greater than the last element
         * in the dp array, if it is not greater than the last element in the dp array,
         * we will try to find the index of the element in the dp array which is just
         * greater than the current element, and we will replace the element at that
         * index with the current element.
